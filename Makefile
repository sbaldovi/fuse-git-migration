# Makefile for fuse-emulator conversion using reposurgeon
#
# Steps to using this:
# 1. Make sure reposurgeon and repotool are on your $PATH.
# 2. For svn, set REMOTE_URL to point at the remote repository
#    you want to convert.
# 3. For cvs, set CVS_HOST to the repo hostname and CVS_MODULE to the module,
#    then uncomment the line that builds REMOTE_URL 
#    Note: for CVS hosts other than Sourceforge or Savannah you will need to 
#    include the path to the CVS modules directory after the hostname.
# 4. Set any required read options, such as --user-ignores or --nobranch,
#    by setting READ_OPTIONS.
# 5. Run 'make stubmap' to create a stub author map.
# 6. (Optional) set REPOSURGEON to point at a faster cython build of the tool.
# 7. Run 'make' to build a converted repository.
#
# The reason both first- and second-stage stream files are generated is that,
# especially with Subversion, making the first-stage stream file is often
# painfully slow. By splitting the process, we lower the overhead of
# experiments with the lift script.
#
# For a production-quality conversion you will need to edit the map
# file and the lift script.  During the process you can set EXTRAS to
# name extra metadata such as a comments mailbox.
#
# Afterwards, you can use the headcompare and tagscompare productions
# to check your work.
